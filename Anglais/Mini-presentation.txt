With climate change causing more frequent extreme weather events, the need for accurate and rapid coastal flooding forecasts has never been more critical.

In France, coastal flooding warnings are part of the Vigilance Vagues Submersion (VVS) system, developed by SHOM and operated by Météo-France.
These systems rely on numerical models that simulate marine hazards several days in advance.

However, improving the accuracy of forecasts requires more complex models, which demand too much computation to be used in real time.

To overcome this limitation, scientists are developing reduced models, also called metamodels.
These metamodels can produce results almost instantly, using simplified input data such as wind speed and direction, tide, and sea level.

The IMT and SHOM are currently developing a high-performance numerical model called TOLOSA, which will make it possible to run a large number of detailed simulations.
This provides the opportunity to build advanced metamodels capable of handling functional input data (like time series) and producing functional outputs such as flooding maps.
